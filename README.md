## Introduction
---
Welcome to the survey report for the 13-week Microsoft Fabric Series, organized by 9JA Data Platform, formerly known as Power BI Naija. This digital transformation platform offers free training on Microsoft tools as a way of giving back to the community. This series, titled Datafluence 2.0, is a follow-up to our previous successful event in 2023.

Upon my appointment as the Community Lead, I was entrusted with the task of overseeing this initiative. I am excited to embark on this journey as we explore the vast realm of data technology and uncover the innovative capabilities of Microsoft Fabric.

#Problem Statement:
---
### Promoting Fabric Platform for Early Adopters:
Fabric Platform is relatively new, requiring promotion efforts to attract early adopters and increase adoption rates.
### Seamless Collaboration During Data Projects:
Collaboration among data professionals faces challenges as different vendors manage solutions like Azure, Real-time Analytics, and Data Science independently, hindering seamless teamwork.
### Difficulty in Establishing a Single Source of Truth:
Getting data professionals to adopt a single source of truth poses a significant barrier, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in data management and analysis.
### Focus Shift towards Data Engineering on Microsoft Fabric Platform:
There is a growing emphasis on data engineering within the Microsoft Fabric Platform, necessitating attention and resources to address evolving needs in this area.
### Lack of Technical Efficiency and Process Optimization:
Past practices have shown deficiencies in technical efficiency and process optimization, highlighting the need for improvement in these areas to enhance overall performance and productivity.

# Data Gathering
---
I developed a Microsoft Forms survey aimed at Data Professionals to gather insights into their identity, sector of operation, job roles, preferred learning mode, and topics of interest. The survey comprises one table with 20 columns and 477 rows of responses. The survey link is provided below:

# Data Modelling 
---
In this project, data modeling requirements are simplified due to the presence of a single table. Therefore, emphasis shifts towards thorough analysis and visualization using Power BI tools. Our objective is to optimize project aspects by leveraging Power BI's capabilities to extract meaningful insights from the data. These insights will inform decision-making processes, enhancing overall planning and execution of the project, which is vital for the 9JA Data Platform community
