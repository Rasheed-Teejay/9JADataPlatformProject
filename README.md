#Problem Statement:
---
### Promoting Fabric Platform for Early Adopters:
Fabric Platform is relatively new, requiring promotion efforts to attract early adopters and increase adoption rates.
### Seamless Collaboration During Data Projects:
Collaboration among data professionals faces challenges as different vendors manage solutions like Azure, Real-time Analytics, and Data Science independently, hindering seamless teamwork.
### Difficulty in Establishing a Single Source of Truth:
Getting data professionals to adopt a single source of truth poses a significant barrier, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in data management and analysis.
### Focus Shift towards Data Engineering on Microsoft Fabric Platform:
There is a growing emphasis on data engineering within the Microsoft Fabric Platform, necessitating attention and resources to address evolving needs in this area.
### Lack of Technical Efficiency and Process Optimization:
Past practices have shown deficiencies in technical efficiency and process optimization, highlighting the need for improvement in these areas to enhance overall performance and productivity.
